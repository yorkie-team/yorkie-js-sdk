# create-yorkie-app

## Usage

You can scaffold yorkie-js-sdk examples by:

```bash
$ npx create-yorkie-app
```

The examples have own local dependencies. So you should install dependencies before running examples.

```bash
# In the directory of the example.
$ npm install
```

Then you can run the examples.

```bash
# In the directory of the example.
$ npm run dev
```

Open the browser and go to the URL that is printed in the terminal.

Note that you are sharing the Yorkie server with other create-yorkie-app users.
If you want to configure own local Yorkie server, refer to [this README](../../examples/README.md).
