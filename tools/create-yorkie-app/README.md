# create-yorkie-app

## Usage

You can scaffold yorkie-js-sdk examples by:

```bash
$ npx create-yorkie-app
```

The examples have own local dependencies. So you should install dependencies before running examples.

```bash
# In the directory of the example.
$ npm install
```

Then you can run the examples.

```bash
# In the directory of the example.
$ npm run dev
```

Open the browser and go to the URL that is printed in the terminal.

## Note

Yorkie API key or local server is necessary to run each example.
You can create and manage your projects and API keys at [Yorkie Dashboard](https://yorkie.dev/dashboard). If you want to configure your own server, refer to [this README](../../examples/README.md).
