/**
 * About `index`, `path`, `size` and `TreePos` in crdt.IndexTree.
 *
 * `index` of crdt.IndexTree represents a absolute position of a node in the tree.
 * `size` is used to calculate the relative index of nodes in the tree.
 * `index` in yorkie.IndexTree inspired by ProseMirror's index.
 *
 * For example, empty paragraph's size is 0 and index 0 is the position of the:
 *    0
 * <p> </p>,                                p.size = 0
 *
 * If a paragraph has <i>, its size becomes 2 and there are 3 indexes:
 *     0   1    2
 *  <p> <i> </i> </p>                       p.size = 2, i.size = 0
 *
 * If the paragraph has <i> and <b>, its size becomes 4:
 *     0   1    2   3   4
 *  <p> <i> </i> <b> </b> </p>              p.size = 4, i.size = 0, b.size = 0
 *     0   1    2   3    4    5   6
 *  <p> <i> </i> <b> </b> <s> </s> </p>     p.size = 6, i.size = 0, b.size = 0, s.size = 0
 *
 * If a paragraph has text, its size becomes length of the characters:
 *     0 1 2 3
 *  <p> A B C </p>                          p.size = 3,   text.size = 3
 *
 * So the size of a node is the sum of the size and type of its children:
 *  `size = children(element type).length * 2 + children.reduce((child, acc) => child.size + acc, 0)`
 *
 * `TreePos` is also used to represent the position in the tree. It contains node and offset.
 * `TreePos` can be converted to `index` and vice versa.
 *
 * For example, if a paragraph has <i>, there are 3 indexes:
 *     0   1    2
 *  <p> <i> </i> </p>                       p.size = 2, i.size = 0
 *
 * In this case, index of TreePos(p, 0) is 0, index of TreePos(p, 1) is 2.
 * Index 1 can be converted to TreePos(i, 0).
 *
 * `path` of crdt.IndexTree represents a position like `index` in crdt.IndexTree.
 * It contains offsets of each node from the root node as elements except the last.
 * The last element of the path represents the position in the parent node.
 *
 * Let's say we have a tree like this:
 *                     0 1 2
 * <p> <i> a b </i> <b> c d </b> </p>
 *
 * The path of the position between 'c' and 'd' is [1, 1]. The first element of the
 * path is the offset of the <b> in <p> and the second element represents the position
 * between 'c' and 'd' in <b>.
